# Python C2 Server Project

This **Python-Based Command and Control (C2)** server was developed as part of my ongoing efforts to expand my penetration testing toolkit. It leverages a beaconing mechanism to route traffic between the attacker and the victim via an intermediate dummy server, providing a high level of anonymity and operational security. This setup ensures that the attacker's IP address is never exposed to the victim.

## Project Structure

The C2 server consists of multiple components working together to create a seamless and secure command-and-control infrastructure:

- **C2 Server (`main-server.py`)**: The core script that runs on the attacker's machine, handling communication with the beacon and the victim.
- **Beacon (`beacon.py`)**: Deployed on a dummy server, the beacon acts as a relay between the attacker and the victim, routing traffic without exposing the attacker’s identity.
- **Payload (`virus.py`)**: A simple Python-based payload designed to establish a connection between the victim and the beacon, allowing the C2 server to issue commands and receive responses.

### Key Features

1. **Anonymized Traffic Routing:**  
   By utilizing a beacon on an external server, the victim only communicates with the beacon server, never directly with the attacker’s C2 server, enhancing anonymity.

2. **Custom Payloads:**  
   The `virus.py` script can be easily modified to include the IP address of the beacon server. This flexibility allows it to be adapted to different targets and scenarios.

3. **Real-Time Command Execution:**  
   The C2 server is capable of issuing commands to the victim in real-time and receiving responses through the relay beacon.

## Project Workflow

1. **Setting Up the C2 Server:**  
   The attacker runs `main-server.py` on their machine, which listens for incoming connections from the beacon. This forms the backbone of the C2 infrastructure.

2. **Deploying the Beacon:**  
   The beacon is hosted on a dummy server, which could be any publicly accessible server. Once the beacon is running, it waits for connections from both the attacker and the victim.

3. **Payload Deployment:**  
   The `virus.py` payload is configured to connect to the beacon server. Once it is executed on the victim's machine, it establishes a connection with the beacon, which then relays the connection to the C2 server.

4. **Traffic Flow Control:**  
   All commands sent by the attacker are routed through the beacon to the victim, and all responses from the victim are routed back through the beacon to the attacker, ensuring that the attacker's IP remains hidden.

### Key Focus Areas

1. **Traffic Anonymization:**  
   The use of a dummy server for traffic routing ensures that the attacker’s real IP remains hidden from the victim. This provides an additional layer of security for long-term engagements.

2. **Payload Customization:**  
   By modifying the payload to include the beacon's IP, this system can be tailored for various environments, making it highly adaptable for different types of penetration tests.

3. **Stealth Operations:**  
   The separation between the victim and the attacker through a relay beacon provides an effective way to maintain stealth and avoid direct detection.

## Challenges Faced

- Ensuring stable connections between the beacon, victim, and C2 server over different network conditions.
- Creating a payload that could be easily deployed while still being flexible enough to handle a wide variety of scenarios.
- Handling real-time communication delays and traffic routing while maintaining stealth.

## Final Thoughts

This Python-based C2 server offers a practical and effective solution for penetration testers looking to keep their operations anonymous. The use of a beacon to relay traffic ensures that the attacker’s identity remains hidden, and the flexibility of the payload allows it to be deployed in multiple environments. This project significantly enhanced my understanding of command-and-control infrastructure and stealthy traffic routing techniques.
