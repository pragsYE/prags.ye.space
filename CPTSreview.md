# CPTS Exam Review

The **Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS)** exam by **Hack The Box** was an exhilarating and intense 10-day journey that pushed my skills to the next level. Out of the 678 candidates who passed this exam, I managed to capture **all 14 flags** in just under 5 days, followed by compiling a detailed report in a single day.

## Exam Structure

The CPTS exam simulates a real-world environment with various machines and services mimicking a companyâ€™s infrastructure. This allowed me to utilize my skills in:

- **Network Enumeration**
- **Vulnerability Exploitation**
- **Privilege Escalation**
- **Post-Exploitation Techniques**
  
### Key Focus Areas

1. **DNS Enumeration:**  
   I leveraged tools such as `dnsenum` to perform zone transfers and collect sensitive data from the organization's DNS server.

2. **Web Exploitation:**  
   By using tools like **SQLMap** and manually inspecting web vulnerabilities, I was able to bypass certain weak login forms and gain unauthorized access.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**  
   Key techniques like **Kerberoasting** and exploiting **misconfigured services** were essential in escalating to higher privilege levels.

## Labs and Preparation

Prior to the exam, I spent hours preparing in **Hack The Box ProLabs**, such as:

- **RastaLabs:** Targeted exploitation of corporate-like environments.

These labs helped me build confidence and understanding of advanced tactics that were directly applicable to the CPTS exam.

### Challenges Faced

- Navigating complex Windows environments.
- Privilege escalation techniques across varied OS versions.
- Dealing with simulated but realistic corporate security practices.

## Final Thoughts

The CPTS exam was well-structured and offered a great experience for those looking to challenge themselves in a professional, real-world pentesting scenario. Completing the exam reinforced my pentesting methodologies and gave me further insight into **real-world attack surfaces**.
