# CRTO Exam Review

The **Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO)** exam, part of **Zero Point Security’s** Red Team Ops course, offers an excellent hands-on experience for anyone wanting to simulate adversarial tactics in a real-world setting. This online, self-study course focuses on the core principles, tools, and techniques synonymous with **red teaming**.

## Course Overview

The course covers the following key areas:
- **Adversary Simulation**: Understanding how real-world threat actors operate.
- **Command & Control**: Learning how to deploy and manage C2 infrastructures.
- **Engagement Planning & Reporting**: Documenting the process from planning an engagement to post-exploitation.
- **Attack Lifecycle**: From initial compromise to full domain takeover, data exfiltration, and lateral movement.

Students also focus on minimizing **OPSEC failures**, which could otherwise result in detection. This is crucial for **stealthy operations** in real-world engagements. Additionally, defenses like **Windows Defender**, **AMSI**, and **AppLocker** are covered, ensuring students know how to bypass these security controls effectively.

## Exam Details

The **CRTO Exam** is a practical, CTF-style event driven by **Snap Labs**. It’s designed around an **assumed breach scenario**, where students must emulate an adversary following a provided **threat profile**. The objective is to escalate privileges, move laterally across the network, and collect flags while avoiding detection.

- **Duration**: 48 hours of active time within a 4-day window.
- **Flags**: There are **8 flags**, and students must collect at least 6 to pass the exam.
- **Environment**: Virtual machines, which can be paused to conserve time.

### My Experience

I successfully completed the exam within **14 hours**, collecting **all 8 flags** and achieving the **Red Team Operator badge**. The exam was intense but manageable with proper planning and execution. Here’s a breakdown of the techniques I used:

1. **Initial Compromise**: I leveraged **Cobalt Strike** for setting up a covert C2 channel.
2. **Lateral Movement**: Bypass techniques such as **Kerberoasting** and **Pass-the-Hash** helped in gaining higher-level privileges.
3. **Persistence and Stealth**: Using custom **PowerShell** scripts, I evaded **Windows Defender** and **AMSI** protections.
4. **Data Exfiltration**: Once full domain access was obtained, I simulated data exfiltration while avoiding detection.

The **Snap Labs environment** provided a realistic adversary simulation, and the clear objective-driven structure made the exam incredibly engaging.

## Final Thoughts

The **CRTO exam** is a highly rewarding certification that tests not only technical skills but also stealthy operations and real-world adversary emulation. The hands-on nature of the exam allowed me to solidify my skills in **red teaming**, with a focus on **OPSEC** and bypassing **security defenses**.

For those looking to pursue a **red team role**, this exam is an excellent stepping stone. Completing it in **14 hours** was a satisfying personal achievement, and I highly recommend this certification to anyone seeking to refine their **offensive security** skills.
